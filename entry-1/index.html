      <p> "Words, letters, and phrases may have existed all around us in New York City. I am frequently startled by quotes and prosaic writings that occur practically wherever I walk, whether it is the subway station, streets, pavements, schools, walls, street signs, graffiti, billboards, or simply packaging. 
    <br><br>
  Quotes serve multiple purposes, often based on how we as individuals interpret them.Textual fragments all across the city, in my opinion, express a longing for Nostalgia. A sentimental yearning or wistful affection for the past, typically for a time or place with joyful personal associations, is what is meant by the word "nostalgia."  For me, nostalgia is the yearning for everything that reminds me of "home"â€”the environment, the people, the tales, the sensations, and the memories that I put on hold the moment I moved abroad. Sometimes it can be a feeling that gives us hope. It can occasionally be a sentiment that inspires hope. It can occasionally serve as a distraction from dealing with the present or the future.  
    <br><br>
  My Harmonic Collection aims to expand the concept of a poetic personal meandering collection, examining multiple perspectives that surround Quotes, Nostalgia, New York City, and myself. The subject of my exploration and experimentation consist of digital elements, fonts, HTML elements, and beyond.
