        Prada Fall Winter 2023: IN A CONVERSATION WITH A FLOWER. 
      </i> <br><br>
      Wandering around SOHO in New York City, I came accross the Prada pop-up booth, where they give out a box of flower seeds, promoting the new Fall Winter 2023 Collection in the theme of Flowers.
      <br><br>
      Along with the flower seeds was a booklet, featuring the visuals of the collection with quotes from different creative directors, illustrating the views upon flowers, humans, and fashion. The quote "In another world, flowers are dominant, humans are decorative." striked me as I navigate through the magazine booklet. 
      <br><br> 
      Imagining the possibilities in a different universe makes me wonder.
      <br><br>
      What are we? 
      <br><br>
      What are we surrounded by? 
      <br><br> 
      Who, are we? 
      <br><br> 
      How many ways are there to view the world differently, that we ignore, nor never thought of? 
      <br><br>
      Why? 
      <br><br> 
      and how? 
      <br><br> 
      So, who, what, where, why, and how? - shall this be the answers we're looking for our whole life?
